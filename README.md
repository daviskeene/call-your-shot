Simple interface for recording shot bets with friends. Deployed [here](https://shots.daviskeene.com).

> [!NOTE]  
> A Shot Bet is like a Slap Bet, where two parties agree upon a certain outcome with a wager of N "shots". The winning party may "call" any of the N shots on a person, making them take a shot of hard liquor, at any time. Shot bet totals do accumulate, and are not destructive.
